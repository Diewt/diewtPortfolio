Hey, I'm a University of Nevada, Reno graduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am trying to improve my coding and plan to use this site to keep track of the projects I work on.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown.
